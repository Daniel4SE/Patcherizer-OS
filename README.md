# Title: Learning to Fully Represent Patches

Patcherizer
=======
Patcherizer, a novel representation learning approach that fuses contextual, structural and sequential information drawn from patches.

## Ⅰ) Dataset

### A) Patch description generation.

### B) Patch correctness assessment. 
  Download _ASE_features2_bert.pickle_ from [data in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7029808#.YwuKF2QzZb8 "Dataset for Quatrain"), 
  accordingly change the absolute path in **PatchCorrectness/config_correctness.py** of this repository as below.
  1. self.path_ASE2020_feature ---> ASE_features2_bert.pickle. The feature from Tian et al.'s ASE2020 [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9286101) for our RQ3 DL experiment. 

### C) JIT defect prediction.

## Ⅱ) Requirements
### A) Environment 
  * python ?
  * pip install -r requirements.txt
